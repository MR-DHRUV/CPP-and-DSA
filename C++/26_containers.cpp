// containers
// Sequence containers -> Linear Fashion me store krta haii eg : list , vector, Dequeue etc slow searching
// vector -> random access fast, add/delete in middle is slow, insertion/deletion at the end is fast   
// list -> random access slow, add/delete in middle is fast, insertion/deletion at the end is fast   

// Associative -> direct access eg : map, multimap, dictionary, set, multiset. all operations fasr except random access

// Derived -> can be derived from sequence or associative containers. used for real world modeling.
