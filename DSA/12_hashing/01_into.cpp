    // drawback :many to one
    // concider the hash function to be %10 then 25,35,5,15 all gives same value that is 5 thus there is a collision 
    
    // solutions to resolve collision
    // 1 Open Hashing: More spaces is used than alocated
    // a chaining

    // 2 Closed Hashing
    // a Open addressing
    //    1 Linear Probing
    //    2 Quadratic Probing
    //    3 Doubble Hashing
